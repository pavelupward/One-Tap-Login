# One-Tap-Login
The new One Tap sign-in and sign-up on Android helps you optimize the flow for authenticating users in your app. For many Android apps, user accounts are an important part of the conversion funnel and a common source of user drop-off. Users (and developers alike!) often forget which account they signed in with or what password they used for your service. By optimizing the process, you can improve conversion rates and reduce drop-off.
It`s just the testable project, please, don't care about code style and solid rules in this project.
